## Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify;">
This study, grounded in the multiscale interaction theoretical framework, investigates the mechanisms governing the eastward acceleration of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) over the equatorial eastern Indian Ocean during boreal winter. Composite observational analysis reveals that MJO with differing propagation speeds modulates the behavior of CCKWs. CCKWs that occurred during the active convective phase of fast MJO (hereafter fast MJO) exhibit faster eastward phase speeds and broader zonal extents than their slow MJO counterparts.  Vertical structure analysis indicates that both CCKW types undergo the canonical evolution of three cloud types: congestus clouds, deep convective clouds, and stratiform clouds. However, CCKWs within the slow MJO tend to display a convective-mode-dominant (CMD) vertical structure, characterized by enhanced column-integrated moistening, broader deep convective heating, and more confined stratiform heating. This vertical structure is further manifested in the zonal wind profile, which displays a well-defined convective-mode pattern. By contrast, CCKWs within the fast MJO exhibit a non-convective-mode-dominant (NCMD) vertical structure. To qualitatively evaluate the dynamical implications of these vertical structural differences, an intraseasonal planetary equatorial synoptic-scale dynamics (IPESD) model was employed to examine the upscale feedback of CMD- and NCMD-type heating on the MJO-like low-level westerly response. The modeling results indicate that NCMD-type heating induces a stronger westerly response, which facilitates moisture accumulation east of the major MJO convection, enhances atmospheric instability, and promotes the eastward propagation of the MJO.
