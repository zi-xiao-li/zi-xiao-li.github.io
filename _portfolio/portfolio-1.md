  <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Upscale Impacts of Convectively Coupled Kelvin Waves on MJO Propagation</h3>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>The convective-mode-dominant (CMD) and non-convective-mode-dominant (NCMD) vertical structures of convectively coupled Kelvin waves (CCKWs) are identified within slow and fast MJO events, respectively.</li>
    <li>An intraseasonal planetary equatorial synoptic-scale dynamics (IPESD) model is used to examine the feedback of CMD- and NCMD-type heating on the MJO-like low-level westerly response through multiscale interaction processes.</li>
    <li>A positive feedback mechanism for MJO acceleration is implied within the IPESD theoretical framework.</li>
  </ul>
