  <h3>Upscale Impacts of Convectively Coupled Kelvin Waves on MJO Propagation</h3>
  <h3>Key Points:</h3>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>In both fast and slow Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events, the vertical structures of convectively coupled Kelvin waves (CCKWs) resemble those of most organized convective systems in the equatorial region, but the relative contributions of deep convection and stratiform precipitation differ substantially.</li>
    <li>Fast MJO events are associated with more vigorous deep convection, characterized by stronger mid-tropospheric zonal convergence, vertically coherent ascent, and a more vertically extensive tropospheric heating. In contrast, slow MJO events exhibit enhanced stratiform development, characterized by a clearer second baroclinic-mode signature in the wind fields and a stronger vertical gradient of mid-tropospheric temperature anomalies to the west of the deepest convection.</li>
    <li>We used the intraseasonal planetary equatorial synoptic dynamics (IPESD) model to examine how different CCKW heating structures affect MJO propagation. In slow MJO events, CCKWs exhibit stronger stratiform development and weaker deep convection, leading to enhanced stratiform heating. This enhanced heating induces a stronger MJO circulation response, which strengthens low-level convergence to the east of the major convection, and thereby favors eastward MJO propagation.</li>
