- The convective-mode-dominant (CMD) and non-convective-mode-dominant (NCMD) vertical structures of convectively coupled Kelvin waves (CCKWs) are identified within slow and fast MJO events, respectively.
- An intraseasonal planetary equatorial synoptic-scale dynamics (IPESD) model is used to examine the feedback of CMD- and NCMD-type heating on the MJO-like low-level westerly response through multiscale interaction processes.
- A positive feedback mechanism for MJO acceleration is implied within the IPESD theoretical framework.
