**Description**  
This project investigates how different vertical heating structures of convectively coupled Kelvin waves (CCKWs) influence the propagation speed of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO). Using reanalysis-based diagnostics and composite analyses, I examined the structural differences between fast- and slow-propagating MJO events and their associated Kelvin wave activity.

**Methods**
- OLR-based filtering and composite analysis  
- Event-based MJO tracking  
- Comparison with theoretical shallow-water solutions
